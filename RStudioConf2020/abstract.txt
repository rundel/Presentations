`livecode`: broadcast your live coding sessions from and to RStudio

In this talk we will demonstrate `livecode`, a new R package for broadcasting code for live code demonstrations. This package implements a simple webserver (using `httpuv`) to dynamically publishes the content of a code file (i.e. `.R` or `.Rmd`) as you edit it live. This enables your students to have near realtime access to your code as you write it. The broadcast file can be viewed with any webbrowser but the package is specifically designed to be used within RStudio leveraging its builtin viewer. This gives students have direct access to the shared code within the IDE, allowing direct copying into their own source files and/or the console and thereby improving their ability to interact and experiment with your code.
