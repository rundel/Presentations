## An overview of Bayesian computational frameworks for teaching

Bayesian modeling has never been more accessible and widespread, this is due in large part to development of modern Bayesian computational frameworks like BUGS, JAGS, Stan, etc. While this wealth of choices is empowering, it can also be overwhelming to new users trying to decide where to start. This is particularly true for instructors who need to carefully weight the advantages and disadvantages of these frameworks in the context of their target audience and desired learning outcomes. In this talk we will discuss some of the more popular options (JAGS, Stan, PyMC3, and others) with a focus on integrating them into a Bayesian modeling courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Specific attention will be given to the larger ecosystem for each framework, as well as considerations around syntax, efficiency,  and performance.
