Computational infrastructure for a modern statistical curriculum

Modern statistics is fundamentally a computational discipline, but too often this fact is not reflected in our statistics curricula. With the rise of big data and data science it has become increasingly clear that students, at both the undergraduate and graduate level, want, expect, and need explicit training in this area of the discipline. To meet these needs we must be more purposeful in how we weave computational education throughout a curriculum with an eye towards consistency and the long terms skills we wish our graduates to have. In this talk we will discuss the specific efforts we have made at Duke Statistical Science to revise and update our undergraduate and graduate curricula in this regard as well as the computational infrastructure and toolkit choices we have adopted to further these pedagogical goals.
