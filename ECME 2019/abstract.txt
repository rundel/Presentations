Live coding for teaching computation

Abstract: Live coding is an active learning technique in which an instructor will lead students through a programming exercise by generating all of the code live in front of the students while narrating their thought process as they work through the problem. This approach has recently begun to grow in popularity within computer science education community and computing heavy disciplines and there is an increasing body of research pointing towards its effectiveness in teaching students how to code as well as algorithmic thinking and related problem solving skills. In this talk I was discuss my own use of this method in both undergraduate and postgraduate statistical computing courses. In particular, I will focus on some of the core workflow and infrastructural considerations that increase the impact of this teaching approach.
