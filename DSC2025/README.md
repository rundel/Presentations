Reflections on a decade of teaching statistical computing

Over the last decade, developing and teaching STA 523 (Programming for Statistical Science) and STA 323 (Statistical Computing) at Duke University has provided a unique vantage point on the evolving landscape of statistics and data science. These courses, required for our master's and undergraduate students, focus on practical and modern approaches to statistical programming using the R programming language, and integrating best practices in version control, collaborative coding, literate and reproducible programming, and efficient computing. The curriculum is designed to be interactive and hands-on, with students engaging in real-world programming challenges spanning data collection, cleaning, visualization, simulation, modeling, and workflow automation. Over the years, the courses have had to adapt to incorporate new tools and pedagogical strategies, reflecting the rapid evolution of the field. This talk will reflect on key developments, challenges, and successes in teaching computational statistics at Duke, highlighting the impact of these approaches both within the courses but also within the larger departmental curricula.
