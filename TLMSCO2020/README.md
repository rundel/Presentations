# Teaching computing using git and GitHub

In this talk we will discuss how Git (a version control system) and GitHub (a remote hosting service for Git repositories) can be integrated into statistics and data science courses. Beyond the advantages and benefits of using a version control system within a course we will discuss how these tools can be used to deliver and collect assignments, promote collaboration, and provide automated feedback to students. We will also discuss the various options for automating the process of interacting with GitHub (e.g. creating student repos) as well as considerations around data protection and privacy.
