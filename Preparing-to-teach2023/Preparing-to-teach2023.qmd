## Teaching Philosophy

> Strictly speaking, your teaching philosophy is a written description of your values, goals, and beliefs regarding both teaching and learning. By contrast, your teaching statement develops from your teaching philosophy and uses evidence from your teaching to make the case that you have excelled as a teacher.”

## Teaching

* What is the teaching load (2/2, 3/3, etc.)?

* What courses will you be expected to teach?

  * What size? What support? What regularity? Repeats vs new preps?

* How is teaching evaluated?

## Research

* What counts as research?

* What are expectations around publishing?

* What are expectations around presenting at conferences?

* Access to graduate students?


## Service

* What counts for service? (departmental, institutional, and professional)

* What and how much service is expected? (e.g. thesis supervision, advising, etc.)


## Reappointment and promotion

* How long is your contract, and how is reappointment decided?

  * Is there a process to provide regular feedback / mentoring

  * Time frame, requirements, etc.


## Internally vs. externally facing work

* Teaching positions have an emphasis on teaching and service which tends to be largely 
internally facing

* It is important for your career to balance this with externally visible work, e.g.

  * Papers, talks, etc.
  
  * Publicly available course materials
  
  * Software packages, data sets, etc.
