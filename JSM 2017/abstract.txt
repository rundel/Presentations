Moving away from ad hoc statistical computing education

Modern statistics is fundamentally a computational discipline, but too often this fact is not reflected in our undergraduate curricula. With the rise of big data and data science it has become increasingly clear that students both want, expect, and need explicit training in this area of the discipline. To best achieve this we must be more purposeful in how we weave computational education throughout a curriculum with an eye towards consistency and the long terms skills we wish our graduates to have. In this talk we will discuss the specific efforts we have made at Duke Statistical Science to revise and update our undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we will discuss our overarching learning objectives for the major and we will provide specific examples from our revised and added courses.
