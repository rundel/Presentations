## `parsermd` - parsing R Markdown for fun ~~and profit~~

## Abstract

`parsermd` is a new R package for parsing and programmatically interacting with R Markdown (Rmd) documents. This package implements a formal grammar for Rmd documents in C++ using Boost's Spirit X3 library and provides additional user facing functions for the resulting abstract syntax tree. In this talk we will provide background on the structure and grammar of Rmd documents as well as discuss the ways in which the parsing of these documents enables a variety of automatable tasks. Specifically, we will focus on demonstrating how these tools can be used to provide automated feedback on student submissions in a statisical programming course.
